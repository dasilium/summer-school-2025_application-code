# Summer School 2025 HS Mannheim

Welcome to the Summer School AWS repository.

Here, you will find:

- The source code of the application that we will deploy on AWS. There is no need to run it locally or modify it for this class.
- More important, the final app where you can find the built application code that we will run on AWS. During the class, we will use this fully prepared source to run the app.
